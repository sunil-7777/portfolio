The system provides crop recommendations based on environmental and soil conditions, fertilizer suggestions tailored to the specific crop and soil type, and diagnoses crop diseases by predicting their names, causes, and potential cures. Built using Python, it leverages libraries like NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, and Flask for data processing, model deployment, and API integrations. With Pillow for image handling and Requests for API calls, this project exemplifies my ability to integrate data science and web technologies to deliver practical, impactful solutions for the farming community.',
